Release 1.0

This firmware added a switchable output between (CVBS,Y,C) and (Y,Pb,Pr) by Pressing button input and option at the same time 

when YPbPR out is selected the Input led is blinking

The actual CVBS output is programed to output (PAL60 and PAL50) at IRE -7.5 level

The option button is maped for switching between NTSC_JP (IRE_0) and NTSC_M (IRE_7.5) decoding (when NTSC is detected).  The option Led is on when NTSC_M input is activated (the button also resets ACE when switching)

i replaced the Pedestal by (ACE) Automatic Contrast Enhancement (it helps getting better black and more colorful picture)

i also activated all Adaptive 2D comb filtering (maybe it needs some tweak)
and double buffering

The input button simply switch between CVBS and Y/C now
